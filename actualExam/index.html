<ol class="theQuestions">

<li class="radixQuestions pageBreakBefore"><p>Please perform the following number conversions.</p></li>

<li class="argcArgvQuestions pageBreakBefore"></li>

<li class="whatTypeQuestions pageBreakBefore"></li>


<li class="pageBreakBefore"><p> (10 pts) In 24 hour time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>midnight is represented by the hour 0</li>
    <li>1am through 11am are represented at hour=1 through hour=11</li>
    <li>noon is represented by hour=12</li>
    <li>1pm through 11pm are represetned by hour=13 through hour=23</li>
    <li>minute is a value between 0 and 59.
  </ul>

Assume the following struct:
  <pre>
// Time of day in 24 hour time
struct Time {
   int h; // hour
   int m; // minute
};
  </pre>

<p>Write the full function definition  for a function that would have the following prototype:</p>

<pre>
  bool isValidTime(Time t);
</pre>

<p>Comply with these instructions for full credit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The function should return true if both of the members of the struct t are valid values for a struct Time.  Otherwise the function should return false.</li>
  <li>Assume that any <code>#include</code> directives you need are ALREADY DONE.  I ONLY want the function definition.  I want the full function definition, and NOTHING ELSE.  PERIOD.</li>
 </ul>
</li>



<li class="pageBreakBefore"><p> (10 pts) Given the same struct definition as in the previous 
    problem, with the same understanding of how are the fields for hour and minutes are to be treated
  in 24 hour time:</p>

    <pre>
// Time of day in 24 hour time
struct Time {
   int h; // hour
   int m; // minute
};
  </pre>

<p>And given the same function prototype for <code>isValidTime</code>,
which you can assume is ALREADY DEFINED and available for you to use (do not redefine it in this
problem)</p>

<pre>
  bool isValidTime(Time t);
</pre>


<p>Write the full function definition  for a function that would have the following prototype:</p>

<pre>
  bool setTime(Time *t, int hour, int min);
</pre>

<p>Comply with these instructions for full credit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the pointer t is NULL, return false, and do nothing.</li>
  <li>If the pointer t is not NULL, copy the values from hour and min into the corresponding fields in the struct pointed to by t.</li>
  <li>Then, USING A FUNCTION CALL TO isValidTime, NOT BY REPEATED THE CODE YOU WROTE FOR THAT FUNCTION, check whether the struct you just initialized is valid.  If so, return true, otherwise return false.   Hint: be careful about matching the types of formal and actual parameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li class="pageBreakBefore"><p> (10 pts) Given the following struct definitions, exactly as in lab09 and lab09</p>
  <pre style="float:right; width:30em;">
    struct Node {
      int data;
      Node *next;
    };

    struct LinkedList {
      Node *head;
      Node *tail;
    };
</pre>

<p>Write the full function definition  for a function that would have the following prototype:</p>

<pre>
  int countOccurences(LinkedList * list, int k);
</pre>

<p>Comply with these instructions for full credit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The function should return 0 if <code>list</code> is NULL, or the the linked list that is pointed to is an empty list.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the function should go through the linked list and count the number of nodes in the list that have the value <code>k</code> in the data member.</li>
  <li>Assume that any <code>#include</code> directives you need are ALREADY DONE.  I ONLY want the function definition.  I want the full function definition, and NOTHING ELSE.  PERIOD.</li>
 </ul>
</li>


  
<li class="pageBreakBefore"><p> (10 pts) Again, given the following struct definitions, exactly as in lab09 and lab09</p>
  <pre style="float:right; width:30em;">
    struct Node {
      int data;
      Node *next;
    };

    struct LinkedList {
      Node *head;
      Node *tail;
    };
</pre>

  <p>Here is a partial implementation of addIntToEndOfList.   It has one extra line of code added that will result in a memory leak, and it has one crucial line of code missing.</p>

  <p>You have two jobs, and you must do this precisely as stated to get full credit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(5 pts) Add EXACTLY ONE LINE OF CODE, the missing line that will cause the function to work properly.</li>
    <li>(5 pts) Cross out EXACTLY ONE LINE OF CODE, the one that causes a memory leak.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>HINT: Trace through the code with a picture, both starting from an empty list, and one that already has at least one node in it.  Think about what you WANT the "after" picture to look like, vs. what the code you see here actualy does.  Then you'll see both thing you need to fix.</p>

  <p>NOTE: there may be 'other' ways to fix the code. I DON'T WANT THOSE.  Fix it according to the instructions.  Also, note that I've put exactly the same amount of space between each line, so that where the white space is is NOT a clue as to where the missing line of code should go.</p>


<pre style="line-height:80%"> 
  void addIntToEndOfList(LinkedList *list, int value) {


   assert(list!=NULL); // if list is NULL, we can do nothing.

  
    Node *p;

 
    p = new Node;

  
    p->data = value;

  
    p->next = NULL;

  
    if (list->head == NULL) {

  
       list->head = new Node;


       list->head = p;

  
    } else {

  
       list->tail->next = p;

  
       list -> tail = p;

  
    }

  
  }
</pre>    

  
</li>
